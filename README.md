## Hello!

My name is Jiali Chen, and I am a third-year undergraduate majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Data Science Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

My passions lie in robotic controls and computer vision. Specifically, I am interested in general-purpose limbed and humanoid robotics, human-machine interaction, traditional and data-based control of mechatronic systems, and autonomous navigation.
