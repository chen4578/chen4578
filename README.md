## Hello

My name is Jiali Chen, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of California (UCLA). I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Data Science Engineering.

My passions lie in robotic controls and computer vision. Specifically, I am interested in general-purpose limbed robotics, human-robot interaction, traditional and AI-based locomotive control of electromechanical systems, and autonomous navigation.
